### Task 0
A file named 0-main.c that tests if the function [positive_or_negative()](https://github.com/Sobilo34/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
- Output Layout
```script
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c 0-main.c -o 0-main
$ ./0-main
0 is zero
$ wc -l 0-main.c
16 1-main.c
$ 
```
### Task 1
Commenting out of the part of code that makes the program to be in Infinite loop inside [1-main.c](https://github.com/Sobilo34/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/1-main.c) file
- Output Layout
```script
$ ./1-last_digit 
Last digit of 629438752 is 2 and is less than 6 and not 0
$ ./1-last_digit 
Last digit of -748255693 is -3 and is less than 6 and not 0
$ ./1-last_digit

```
### Task 2
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Output Layout
```script
$ ./2-print_alphabet 
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
$
```
### Task 3
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- Output Layout
```script
$ ./3-print_alphabets | cat -e
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ$
$
```
