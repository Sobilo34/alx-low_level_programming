### Task 0
A file named 0-main.c that tests that the function ![positive_or_negative()]() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
- Output Layout
```script
$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-520693284 is negative
$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-973398895 is negative
$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-199220452 is negative
$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
561319348 is positive
$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
561319348 is positive
$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
266853958 is positive
$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-48147767 is negative
$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
0 is zero
$ 
_putchar
